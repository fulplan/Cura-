## What We Currently Lack (Critical Issues)

### ðŸ”´ **High Priority Issues**
1. **No Real Functionality**: All buttons and actions only log to console
2. **Mock Data Everywhere**: No real database connections or API calls
3. **State-Based Routing**: Should use proper URL routing for navigation
4. **No Authentication**: Missing user login/logout and security
5. **No Data Persistence**: Changes don't save anywhere

### ðŸŸ¡ **Medium Priority Issues**
1. **No Content Creation**: Cannot actually create or edit posts
2. **No File Upload**: Media library is purely visual
3. **No User Management**: Cannot manage users or permissions
4. **No Search Functionality**: Search inputs don't work
5. **No Real Notifications**: Notification system is placeholder
